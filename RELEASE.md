# Release instructions

This application is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), but it can also be executed in production mode locally.

## Design overview
It is designed to do the following:
1. Use a cron schedule to execute the main `hubcap.py` script at the beginning of every hour
2. The `hubcap.py` script creates a temporary directory to hold cloned git repositories (default is `/target`)
3. `hubcap.py` creates a JSON spec file for each git repo + git tag combo within the `/target/hub.getdbt.com/data/packages/` directory (by default)
4. It opens pull requests against [dbt-labs/hub.getdbt.com](https://github.com/dbt-labs/hub.getdbt.com) for any new versions of dbt packages
    - [Example PR for first-time package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/hub.getdbt.com/pull/1681/files)
    - [Example PR for new version of existing package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/hub.getdbt.com/pull/1683/files)

## Heroku production setup

The commands below assume a production application named `dbt-hubcap`. Replace with `dbt-hubcap-staging` for the staging version of the application.

1. Use the [Heroku Scheduler](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/dbt-hubcap/scheduler) to set the following cron schedule:
    - Job: `python3 hubcap.py`
    - Schedule: Every hour at :00
    - Dyno size: Hobby / Standard-1X
1. Configure the `CONFIG` environment variable: [Settings > Config Vars > Reveal Config Vars](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/dbt-hubcap/settings)
    - `CONFIG`: copy format from `config.example.json` and adjust values as needed
1. (Re-)deploy the application using the instructions below. See [these](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/dbt-hubcap/deploy/heroku-git) instructions for context.


## Heroku production release (automated)

It is possible to configure automatic deploys from GitHub to deploy automatically whenever a specific branch is pushed to: [Deploy > Deployment method > GitHub > Connect to GitHub](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/dbt-hubcap/deploy/github).

## Heroku production release (manual)

All of the following steps can be performed locally to initiate a remote deploy on Heroku.

### Install the Heroku CLI
Download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).

If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.

```shell
heroku login
```

### Deploy

To deploy or re-deploy the latest changes:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:dbt-labs/hubcap.git
cd hubcap
git pull origin
git checkout main
heroku git:remote -a dbt-hubcap
git push heroku main:main
```

### Ad hoc executions of the script

For off-schedule ad hoc executions, run the following from the deploy directory above:

```shell
heroku run python3 hubcap.py
```

#### Explanation

`heroku` is the remote that Heroku will use for deploys. `origin` is the source code hosted on GitHub.

Pulling from `origin` will get the latest code in GitHub. Pushing to `heroku` will deploy that latest code to the Heroku app.

You can use the following command to list the tracked repositories:
```shell
git remote -v
```

The result should be something like the following:
```
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/dbt-hubcap.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/dbt-hubcap.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:dbt-labs/hubcap.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:dbt-labs/hubcap.git (push)
```
